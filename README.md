# TheNothing

TheNothing is an alpha version of my own attack vector against traditional RSA

Currently, it is configured for a chosen plaintext attack.  It makes an educated guess on what the totient should be and then brute forces from there.

TheNothing hopes to be faster than using Fermat's theorem to factor P and Q.
