# TheNothing

*** River Ridge High School Project

*** Requires pycrypto and gmpy2

Alpha verddsion of some RSA attacks

TheNothing is based on the ZanderTheoremZ function.  The function factors RSA primes in a timely manner.

Prime ranges confirmed cracked (all computations were done on a slow MacBook Air):

16 bit - 0 seconds

24 bit - 5-30 seconds

32 bit - 30-90 seconds

34 bit - 120-200 seconds

36 bit - 98-101 seconds

38 bit - 569-1000 seconds

40 bit - 379 seconds

42 bit -
